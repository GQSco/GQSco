**GQSco/GQSco** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making programs to make my adjustment to college life easier: A schedule maker, a room finder, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned how to ride the unicycle for an 8th grade langauge arts project
